# Versioning

Mancer documentation uses [Mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) for versioning.

## How it works
- Each release, documentation is built and published as a new version.
- You can select the documentation version using the version selector in the navigation bar.

## Commands
```bash
mike deploy --update-aliases v1.0 latest
```

See the [Mike documentation](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) for more details.
