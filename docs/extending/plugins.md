# Plugins

Mancer is designed to be extensible. In the future, a plugin system will allow you to add new features without modifying the core codebase.

## Current Extensibility
- Custom commands
- Custom backends

## Planned Plugin System
- Register plugins via configuration
- Discover and load plugins automatically

Stay tuned for updates!
